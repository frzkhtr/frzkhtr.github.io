I am Data Scientist at Dslab @ [cars24](https://www.cars24.com/). previously, I worked at [Brillio Technologies](https://www.brillio.com/). 


### What I am doing as Data scientist?

New-Gen price modelling of used cars that is par to the market.

Inventory management & pricing using AI.

### Do I always Work?

Wouldn't that be boring? 

Aside from work, to increase my knowledge, I read blogs and new techniques and try to apply on different use case.

Currently, I am applying the concept of transfer learning to drastically increase my model efficiency.

I am always accompanied by [Ryuk]() who is always in the mood to play. Most of my free time is reserved for him :)
