I am Data Scientist at Dslab @ [cars24](https://www.cars24.com/). previously, I worked at [Brillio Technologies](https://www.brillio.com/). 


### What I am doing as Data scientist?
My role at Cars24 involves building end to end pricing strategies and models for the product portfolio. While working here, I have developed a deep understanding of pricing dynamics for unlabelled products. My work has involved conducting market research, analyzing competitors’ strategies, identifying pricing opportunities that align with the company’s overall business objective and delivering end to end AI solutions for the same.

Apart from this, I also developed the base depreciation model to determine the average depreciation for each fingerprint(make, model) which also varies based on the state where vehicle was being used.


### Do I always Work?

Wouldn't that be so boring and monotonous? 

Aside from work, I spend my leisure in playing chess, badminton or football. I am always accompanied by [Ryuk]() who is always in the mood to play. Most of my free time is reserved for him :)


Currently I am reading a book [Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases](https://www.amazon.in/Judgment-under-Uncertainty-Heuristics-Biases/dp/0521284147) by [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) & [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky) which reviews the studies and experiments done for the [paper](https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc590Readings/TverskyKahneman1974.pdf) and persons of same name. The paper explores how people make judgments and decisions under conditions of uncertainty. It presents various cognitive biases and heuristics that people use when making judgments, such as the availability heuristic, representativeness heuristic, and anchoring effect. The paper highlights how these biases and heuristics can lead to errors and irrational decision-making. Finally, it emphasizes the importance of understanding these biases and heuristics in order to improve decision-making processes in various fields. Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman were two psychologists who conducted groundbreaking research in the field of cognitive psychology. Their collaboration resulted in the development of several influential theories and concepts that continue to shape the way we understand human decision-making today. Tversky was a professor of psychology at Stanford University, while Kahneman was a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University.Tversky was a professor of psychology at Stanford University, while Kahneman was a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University. In 2002, Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work in the field of behavioral economics. However, Tversky passed away in 1996 and was therefore not eligible for the Nobel Prize.
