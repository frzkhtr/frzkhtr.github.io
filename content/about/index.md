I am Data Scientist at Dslab @ [cars24](https://www.cars24.com/). previously, I worked at [Brillio Technologies](https://www.brillio.com/). 


### What I am doing as Data scientist?
I develop Pricing strategy for used cars and implementing it in real time. Determining the price of any used items is much difficult than it seems. Apart from its conditions (wear and tear), price is heavly affected by the influence of market (economy, supply, demand etc), availability of its new counterpart(from the manufactorer's end, geography, regulation or acts by the government and many more. For ex: Chevrolet cease the sale of cars in India from 2018. As a result, depreciation is more in Chevrolet than any other car brands.
I develop PAN India pricing strategies and model to accurately determine the price which should be assenting to both seller and buyer. 
For strategies, I do univariate & multivariate analysis of car features to determine its WOE and IV, determining directional impact of features. I developed loss function for model to consume based on its age, state and depreciation; calculating base depreciated price according to current market condition. I developed 2 Pan India pricing models for 2 different products (online selling and pucrchasing based on set of questionnaires; on full inspection details of cars).

Apart from this, I also developed the base depreciation model to determine the average depreciation for each fingerprint(make, model, variant, year or MMVY) which also varies based on the state where vehicle was being used.

Inventory management & pricing using AI.

### Do I always Work?

Wouldn't that be so boring and monotonous? 

Aside from work, I spend my leisure in playing chess, badminton or football. I am always accompanied by [Ryuk]() who is always in the mood to play. Most of my free time is reserved for him :)
