I am Senior Engineer (Data Science) at [Brillio Technologies](https://www.brillio.com/). Previously, I graduated with a Dual Degree(B.tech + M.tech) in Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering from the department of Biotechnology from [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).

### What I do as Senior Engineer

My work revolves around playing with data to generate trends and insights, using the tuned model to improve its efficiency, building ML pipelines, and deployments. 

Currently, I am working on building an End-2-End Timeseries forecasting pipeline.


### Do I always Work?

Wouldn't that be boring? 

Aside from work, to increase my knowledge, I read blogs and new techniques and try to apply on different use case.

Currently, I am applying the concept of transfer learning to drastically increase my model efficiency.

I am always accompanied by [Ryuk]() who is always in the mood to play. Most of my free time is reserved for him :)
