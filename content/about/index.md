I am Data Scientist at Dslab @ [cars24](https://www.cars24.com/). previously, I worked at [Brillio Technologies](https://www.brillio.com/). 


### What I am doing as Data scientist?
My role at Cars24 involves building end to end pricing strategies and models for the product portfolio. While working here, I have developed a deep understanding of pricing dynamics for unlabelled products. My work has involved conducting market research, analyzing competitors’ strategies, identifying pricing opportunities that align with the company’s overall business objective and delivering end to end AI solutions for the same.

Apart from this, I also developed the base depreciation model to determine the average depreciation for each fingerprint(make, model, variant, year or MMVY) which also varies based on the state where vehicle was being used.


### Do I always Work?

Wouldn't that be so boring and monotonous? 

Aside from work, I spend my leisure in playing chess, badminton or football. I am always accompanied by [Ryuk]() who is always in the mood to play. Most of my free time is reserved for him :)
