I am excited to announce that next month, I will be releasing a blog on the topic of "Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases." This blog will delve into the research conducted by Nobel Prize-winning psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who identified various cognitive biases that affect our decision-making processes. I will explore how these biases can lead to errors in judgment, both in everyday life and in more significant contexts such as politics and finance. This blog aims to provide insight into the mechanisms of our decision-making processes and how we can become more aware of the biases that affect us. Stay tuned for this insightful and thought-provoking blog, and join me as I explore the fascinating world of judgment under uncertainty.
